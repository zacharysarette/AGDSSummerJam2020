Story:
You've found yourself stuck underground with nothing but a shovel. How convenient.
You've heard that great treasures can be found deep in the caves, but they're crawling with monsters, and whats worse? 
You can't breathe the air.
Somehow, you can squeeze your way through the rocks and dirt just fine though...

Objective:
Stay within the walls, going into the open caves will hurt you.
Use your shovel to collapse parts of the caves and trap / kill the enemies. It's probably worthwile checking their pockets too!
If the treasure isn't buried already, you'll need to bury it before you can safely collect it.
